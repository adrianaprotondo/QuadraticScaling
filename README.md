# Quadratic scaling 

In this project we investigate how adding parameters to a loss changes the geometry of the loss landscape in a way that can either be beneficial or detrimental to learning.  

We consider the case of a quadratic loss function as it is mathematically tractable. 

## Getting started

The whole project is implemented in [Julia](https://docs.Wjulialang.org/en/v1/).  

1. Download [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/#long_term_support_release).
2. cd to the folder where you want to clone the project.
3. clone the repo on your device
```
git init
git clone https://github.com/adrianaprotondo/QuadraticScaling.git
```
